NOTE FROM DIANA
Let's start with a query that can provide you with a list of Knowledge Patterns (KPs) that use reification in some way.

select * {
  ?kp a <http://www.researchspace.org/resource/system/fields/Field> .
  ?kp <http://www.researchspace.org/resource/system/fields/selectPattern> ?selectPattern .
  ?kp <http://www.researchspace.org/resource/system/fields/insertPattern> ?insertPattern .
  ?selectPattern <http://spinrdf.org/sp#text> ?selecttext .
  ?insertPattern <http://spinrdf.org/sp#text> ?inserttext .
  FILTER (CONTAINS(STR(?selecttext),"crm:PC"))
 # FILTER (CONTAINS(STR(?inserttext),"crm:PC"))
}

What this query does is it looks for KPs that contain crm:PC... properties. From the long list of results, let's consider for example: http://www.researchspace.org/pattern/system/title/has_title_range and http://www.researchspace.org/pattern/system/human-made_thing/PC102_has_title These two KPs work together to help define not just the title 
but qualify which title is it. So across the list of KPs you got from the earlier search there will always be a pair of KPs working together 
to qualify a relationship where it is needed. The data created by the two KPs in this case is what any reification requires.
